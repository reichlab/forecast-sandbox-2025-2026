# Reich Lab Forecasting Testbed for the 2025-2026 season

This is the sandbox/testbed for experimental forecasts used by the Reich Lab to be used before and during the 2025/2026 respiratory virus forecasting season. The hub is modeled after the FluSight Forecast Hub. The models contained in the hub are instances of models from [idmodels](https://github.com/reichlab/idmodels), as implemented in [operational-models](https://github.com/reichlab/operational-models/), with data pipelines from [iddata](https://github.com/reichlab/iddata/).
