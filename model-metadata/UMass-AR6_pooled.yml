methods_long: "
  This is an AR(6) model fit jointly to all locations using Bayesian methods.
  Prior to model estimation, we perform the following three data transformations:
   1. Convert hospitalization counts to a rate per 100,000 population.
   2. Take the fourth root.
   3. Scale and center, dividing by the 95th percentile of all weekly values for
      the given location and subsequently subtracting the mean.
  Predictions on the transformed scale are converted back to predictions on the
  original scale by inverting these transformations.
