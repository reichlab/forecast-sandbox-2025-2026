  This is an ARIMA(p=6, d=1) model fit jointly to all locations using Bayesian methods.
  This model pools ARIMA parameters (theta) across all locations.
  Prior to model estimation, we perform the following three data transformations:
   1. Convert hospitalization counts to a rate per 100,000 population.
   2. Take the fourth root.
   3. Scale and center, dividing by the 95th percentile of all weekly values for
      the given location and subsequently subtracting the mean.
  Predictions on the transformed scale are converted back to predictions on the
  original scale by inverting these transformations.
  We incorporate annual seasonal patterns using Fourier harmonics with K=2,
  which adds sine and cosine terms for the first two harmonics of the annual
  cycle (period of 365.25 days). Fourier coefficients are estimated separately
  for each location, while AR parameters are shared across locations.
