  2024/25 season:
  A quantile average of two models:
   1. Gradient boosting quantile regression, fit to NHSN, FluSurv-NET, and ILINet data
   2. An AR(6) model fit to NHSN only, with AR coefficients shared across locations and per-location variance parameters.
  As of 2024-11-23, these are equally weighted.
  Categorical predictions are derived from the quantile predictions by fitting a monotonic spline to interpolate the quantiles."
